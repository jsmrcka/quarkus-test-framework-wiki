# Scenario Execution Common Properties

Test suites are meant to be run as batch jobs and use different versions and build numbers, hence there are some common properties 
that we can use to uniquely identify the job execution:

- ts.global.service-name: your application service name 
        Default Value: `quarkus-test-framework`
        Example `myCryptoApp`
- ts.global.build-number: could be your Jenkins pipeline build number, in order to filter in Jaeger by this build.
        Default Value: `quarkus.platform.version` system property value, otherwise `777-default`.
- ts.global.version-number: if your application is versioned, could be the version of your application
        Default Value: the Quarkus platform version 
        

# Tracing

The test framework will trace all your test/method invocations, so you can review how much time took to run a test
or filter by tags as `openshift`, `bare-metal`, `k8s` or errors. 

All the [Junit Tags](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests-tagging-and-filtering) are going to 
be included as Span tags, so then later you can filter in Jaeger by your custom tags. 

All errors are going to be tagged as `error` and the error message is going to be attached to your span as an event log.

In order to push your tracing events to your Jaeger you must provide the following system properties:
- ts.global.tracing.jaeger.endpoint:
        Default Value: `http://localhost:14268/api/traces` 
        Example, `https://myjaeger.apps.ocp47.dynamic.quarkus:14268/api/traces`
        
All the metrics will be tagging [the test execution properties](#Scenario-Execution-Common-Properties).

## Jaeger Installation

- On baremetal:

```
docker run -p 16686:16686 -p 14268:14268 quay.io/jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.21.0
```

The JAEGER API URL will be available at `http://localhost:14268`.
The JAEGER UI URL is `http://localhost:16686`.

- On OpenShift:

```
oc new-project <PROJECT WHERE YOU WANT JAEGER TO BE INSTALLED>
oc apply -f jaeger-for-tracing.yaml
```

In order to get the Jaeger routes, do `oc get routes`:

```
jaeger-api   <JAEGER API URL>          jaeger-api   <all>                 None
jaeger-ui    <JAEGER UI URL>           jaeger-ui    <all>                 None
```

## Usage

After installing Jaeger, then we can run our test suite, for example: 

```
mvn clean verify -Dts.global.build-number="475" -Dts.global.service-name="1.2.1" -Dts.global.tracing.jaeger.endpoint="http://<JAEGER API URL>/api/traces" 
```

The spanIds within the test framework must follow the next convention:

- For a test method: `<ClassName>_<methodName>`
- For a Test Scenario: `<ClassName>`
- For a service: `<ClassName>` and the service name should be attached as a tag. For example, `AlertMonitorIT` Tags: `kafka`

# Metrics

Quarkus test framework uses Prometheus Pushgateway in order to expose test metrics. This feature is enabled by default. 
You can turn off by setting `-Dts.global.metrics.enabled=false`. 
All the metrics will be tagging [the test execution properties](#Scenario-Execution-Common-Properties).

These are the basic metrics that are exposed:

- Metrics
   - `tests_total` represents the total amount of test
   - `tests_succeed` represents the total amount of succeed test
   - `tests_ignored` represents the total amount of ignored test
   - `tests_failed` represents the total amount of failures
   - `scenario_duration_seconds` represents the total duration of the scenario

- Commons labels
   - `scenario_name` represents the running scenario (class name of the test)
   - `module_name` represents the maven modules name
   - `module_status` could be `module_success` or `module_fail`
   - `execution_build_number`
   - `execution_quarkus_version`
   - `execution_service_name`
   - `execution_platform` could be `bare-metal`, `ocp` or `k8s` 

## File exporter

By default, when the metrics extension is enabled, the metrics are exported into the file `target/logs/metrics.out`. We can
configure the output file using `-Dts.global.metrics.export.file.output=/to/metrics.out`.

## Prometheus Gateway

In order to enable the Prometheus exported, you need to provide the following system properties:
- ts.global.metrics.export.prometheus.endpoint:
        Default Value: `127.0.0.1:9091` 
        Example, `myprometheus.apps.ocp47.dynamic.quarkus:9091`
