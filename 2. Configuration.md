Test framework allows to customise the configuration for the running test scenario via a `test.properties` file placed under `src/test/resources` folder.
Also, a global properties file can be specified using the system property `mvn clean verify -Dts.test.resources.file.location=path/to/custom-global.properties`.

All the properties can be configured globally by replacing `<YOUR SERVICE NAME>` with the `global` scope where the `YOUR SERVICE NAME` matches with the field name of the service, for example:

```java
@QuarkusScenario
public class PingPongResourceIT {

    @QuarkusApplication
    static final RestService app = new RestService();

    // ...
}
```

The `<YOUR SERVICE NAME>` value is `app`.

The current configuration options are: 

# Quarkus Expected Output

```
ts.global.quarkus.expected.log=Installed features
```

# Logging

In order to set the logging level (INFO by default), use:

```
# Possible values are: INFO, FINE, WARNING, SEVERE
ts.global.log.level=INFO 
```

The same with the formatter log message and the target file:

```
ts.global.log.format=%d{HH:mm:ss,SSS} %-5p %s%e%n
ts.global.log.file.output=target/logs
```

Moreover, we can turn on/off (on by default) the logging by services using :

```
ts.<YOUR SERVICE NAME>.log.enable=true
```

We can disable the logging for all your services by using `-Dts.global.log.enable=false`.

# Timeouts

Timeouts are quite important property to, as an example, control how long to wait for a service to start. The existing options to configure timeouts are:
 
```
# Startup timeout for services is 5 minutes
ts.<global or YOUR SERVICE NAME>.startup.timeout=5m
# Default startup check poll interval is every 2 seconds
ts.<global or YOUR SERVICE NAME>.startup.check-poll-interval=2s
# Install operator timeout is 10 minutes
ts.<global or YOUR SERVICE NAME>.operator.install.timeout=10m
# Install image stream timeout is 5 minutes
ts.<global or YOUR SERVICE NAME>.imagestream.install.timeout=5m
```

In order to increase the default timeout for all the services, we can use the `global` scope. For example, to increase the default startup timeout: `ts.global.startup.timeout=10m`. Also, we can configure how often the test framework will check for the startup condition using the property `ts.global.startup.check-poll-interval=3s`. Using these two properties, we are making all the services to wait up to 10 minutes to start and checking the condition every 3 seconds.

If we want to update the timeout for a single service because we know that this service is quite slow, we should use the property using the service name scope `ts.ping.startup.timeout=20m` to wait up to 20 min for only the ping application to start. 

How can we manipulate the overall timeout in slower environments? Let's say that our environment is twice and a half slower than a good environment, then we can instruct the test framework with:

```
ts.global.factor.timeout=2.5
```

And all the timeouts will take into account this factor value. For example, if previously, the startup timeout was 10 minutes, now it will be 10 * 2.5 = 25 minutes.

In a Multi-Module Maven test suite, if we want to configure the timeouts, we can do this via system properties:
- Increase the startup timeout only: `mvn clean verify -Dts.global.startup.timeout=20m`
- Increase all the timeouts at once using the factor: `mvn clean verify -Dts.global.factor.timeout=2.5`

# Ports

The framework will allocate ports to deploy the services. We can configure the port range and the strategy to find an available port using:

```
ts.global.port.range.min=1100
ts.global.port.range.max=49151
## incremental (default) or random
ts.global.port.resolution.strategy=incremental
```

# Maven

The framework will use Maven commands for some scenarios like Dev Mode and Remote Dev Mode. We can configure the properties we want to propagate to these internal Maven commands using:

```
# Propagate Properties strategy to use in all Maven commands: 
## - all: by default
## - none
## - only-quarkus: only properties starting with "quarkus."
ts.global.maven.propagate-properties-strategy=all
# When selecting the `all` strategy, the properties that start with any of the next list will be ignored:
ts.global.maven.propagate-properties-strategy.all.exclude=sun.,awt.,java.,surefire.,user.,os.,jdk.,file.,basedir,line.,path.
```
